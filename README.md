## Configuration

### Using Homebridge Config UI X

After installation, configure the plugin through the Homebridge web interface. You'll need:

- Your PetLibro account email
- Your PetLibro account password
- Number of portions to dispense (optional, defaults to 1)

### Manual Configuration

Add the following to your Homebridge `config.json` in the `platforms` section:

```json
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "PetLibroPlatform",
      "name": "Pet Feeder",
      "email": "your-petlibro-email@example.com",
      "password": "your-petlibro-password",
      "portions": 1,
      "timezone": "America/New_York",
      "country": "US"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Required | Default | Description |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `platform` | Yes | | Must be `"PetLibroPlatform"` |
| `name` | No | `"Pet Feeder"` | Display name in Home app |
| `email` | Yes | | Your PetLibro account email |
| `password` | Yes | | Your PetLibro account password |
| `portions` | No | `1` | Number of portions per feeding (1-10) |

| `deviceId` | No | | Specific device ID (auto-detected) |

## Important Setup Notes

### Account Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **PetLibro only allows one device to be logged into an account at a time.**

**Recommended Setup:**
1. Create a second PetLibro account with a different email
2. In your main PetLibro app, share your feeder to the new account
3. Use the new account credentials in this Homebridge plugin

This allows both your mobile app and Homebridge to work simultaneously.

### Verification Steps

Before configuring the plugin:
1. ‚úÖ Verify your credentials work in the official PetLibro mobile app
2. ‚úÖ Ensure you're using the main "PetLibro" app (not "PetLibro Lite")
3. ‚úÖ Confirm your feeder is connected to WiFi and working normally

## Usage

1. After configuration, your feeder will appear as a switch in the Home app
2. Tap the switch to trigger a manual feeding
3. The switch automatically turns off after 1 second (momentary behavior)
4. Check Homebridge logs to confirm feeding was successful

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: Plugin fails to authenticate
- ‚úÖ Verify email/password work in the PetLibro mobile app
- ‚úÖ Ensure only one device is logged into your PetLibro account
- ‚úÖ Try creating a dedicated account for Homebridge (recommended)

### Device Not Found

**Problem**: Plugin authenticates but can't find your feeder
- ‚úÖ Confirm your feeder appears in the PetLibro mobile app
- ‚úÖ Check that device sharing is set up correctly (if using separate account)
- ‚úÖ Look at Homebridge logs for device discovery details

### Feeding Not Working

**Problem**: Switch appears but feeding doesn't work
- ‚úÖ Ensure feeder has food and is powered on
- ‚úÖ Verify feeder connectivity in the PetLibro app
- ‚úÖ Check Homebridge logs for API error messages
- ‚úÖ Try manual feeding through the official app first

### Common Error Messages

**"Invalid account or password"**
- Check credentials are correct
- Ensure no other device is logged into the account

**"Device ID not found"**
- Verify device sharing is configured properly
- Check that the feeder appears in your account

**"Authentication failed: SYSTEM_ERROR"**
- Usually indicates incorrect API credentials
- Verify you're using the main PetLibro app (not Lite)

### API Endpoints Used
- Authentication: `POST /member/auth/login`
